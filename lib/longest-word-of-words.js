/*
A "Word of Words" is a word where, upon removing a character,
the remaining characters make a word. Take BOAT for example:

    _OAT    Popular with that Quaker guy
    B_AT    Produces a delicacy in some countries
    BO_T    Something I hope will do all my chores
    BOA_    Harry Potter can speak to this
